            Bus stands serve as crucial transportation hubs, connecting various routes and facilitating the movement of people between different locations.
        Bus stands typically provide designated waiting areas for passengers, offering seating and shelter from the weather.
Many modern bus stands have electronic displays or boards showing bus schedules, routes, and other relevant information.
 Some bus stands have ticket counters where passengers can purchase tickets or get information about fares and routes.
 Security measures like surveillance cameras and personnel may be present to ensure the safety of passengers and prevent unauthorized activities.
Depending on the size and location, bus stands may offer amenities such as restrooms, shops, and refreshment stalls.
